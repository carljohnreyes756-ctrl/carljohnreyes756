 🎮 Game Description
 
Mind Match is a responsive and aesthetic browser-based memory puzzle game designed to test focus and cognitive speed. The game features a dreamy, animated gradient background with a modern Glassmorphism UI (frosted glass effect) to create a relaxing yet engaging experience.

Players must race against the clock to match pairs of emojis. The game includes three progressive difficulty levels, a real-time move counter, and a countdown timer. It demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation, CSS animations, and game state management using vanilla Web Technologies.

This project was created for educational purposes to demonstrate proficiency in basic Web Development.
